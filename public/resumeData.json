    "bio": "A world lacking in innovation is a boring one. The fastest, surest way to bring forth innovation is in the space of technology.  With that being said I have chosen to enter this space with as much enthusiasm and self -determination as I can possibly bring. Being a software engineer is being a creator, and a word that stems from that is creative. Creativity is born out of imagination, which I feel is what makes me a great engineer. The languages I am most proficient in are Javascript, React, HTML, & CSS. I am also familiar with Agile and SDLC theory.",
